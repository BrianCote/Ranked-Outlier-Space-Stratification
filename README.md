# Ranked-Outlier-Space-Stratification

Currently used in other personal projects, figured it might be time to give it its own repo. 

TODO: 
- App-ify into a PyPi package
- Upload test examples
- Take the time to make some unit & integration tests
- Expand this ReadMe 
- Integrate to dynamically allow numpy and pandas use without outside fiddling.
